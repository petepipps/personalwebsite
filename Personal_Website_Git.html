			<p> My name is Peter Pippis. I have a beutiful son. His name is Anthony and is 9 years old. I have five brothers, no sisters. Yeah you can say my childhood was rough but we always stuck together. I grew up in Queens, New York in a town called Sunnyside. 
			<br>
			<br>
			I enjoy the simple things in life. Being happy is a state of mind, and I don't think people should settle for less than they deserve. I always look toward the next best thing. I like seeing other people happy. I've been through more than most people my age, but hey, it's what has made me stronger. Life has thrown me challenges, and so far, I've come out on top. I realized who my real friends are, and that my family always comes first..always. I look out for people even if I don't know them that well. I see the best in almost everyone I meet - if they're rude or mean I just assume that it's because of events that have happened in their lives and not simply because some people are just mean to be mean.

			<br>
			I love music and movies. Walking Dead and Game of Thrones are my favorite TV shows, so that means Sunday nights I'm unavailable! I love to laugh and be silly but also know when to be serious. 
			<br>
			<br>
			I tend to think I am always right. I take on way too many responsibilites even if it stresses me out because I can't say no for fear of letting someone down. I'm changing that about myself, little by little. I love life. I appreciate the things that I have. Happy that I have good health and have a good family.</p>
